# reddit-cyborg

Reddit Cyborg is a personal automation assistant running under my main account /u/noeatnosleep. It is similar to AutoModerator in design.

Reddit Cyborg is my only bot that is not available for easy widespread usage. This decision is due to its ability to issue automated subreddit bans based on arbitrarily specified criteria. While I have a specific and necessary use for this feature, please remember that automated bans are usually poor form.

If you are interested in running a clone of Cyborg yourself, feel free to fork the project.

#Valid Arguments

* `subreddit` - must be a `[list, of, subreddits]`
* `author_name` - must be a `[list, of, usernames]`
* `body` - must be a `[list, of, words]`. Applies only to comments and text submissions
* `domain` - must be a `[list.of, domai.ns]`. Applies only to link submissions
* `body_regex` - must be a `['list of one( or more)? regular expressions?']`. Applies only to comments and text submissions.
